This directory has a bare-bones setup for building a React project with webpack!

1. Do `npm install`
1. Edit the source code
1. Do `npm run full` to generate a full build, including copying assets
1. See the end result in the `dist` folder!

Then, as you keep working:

1. Do further changes to the source code
1. Do `npm run build` to regenerate the bundle
1. Alternatively, do `npm run watch` to have the bundle regenerated everytime you save a file
